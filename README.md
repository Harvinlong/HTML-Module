# Web-Scraping-with-HTML-Mission_to_Mars-

## The Purpose of this project:
The purpose of this project is to build a web-scraping and data analysis project for a mission to Mars. The project involves identifying HTML elements, extracting information using automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup, and scraping various types of information such as HTML tables and recurring elements like multiple news articles on a webpage. The goal is to scrape, organize, analyze, and visualize the data in order to communicate insights about the mission to Mars. The project aims to strengthen the core skills of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and visually communicating data.

## Steps:
The dataset contains information about the transmissions from the Curiosity rover on Mars, including the identification number, date on Earth, number of elapsed Martian days, solar longitude, Martian month, minimum temperature, and atmospheric pressure. 

The data is analyzed using Pandas functions to answer questions such as:
1: how many months exist on Mars
2: how many Martian day's worth of data exist in the dataset
3: what are the coldest and warmest months on Mars
4: Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars
5: How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year. 

The analysis is visually represented using bar charts and plotting the daily minimum temperature.
